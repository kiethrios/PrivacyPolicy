  <h1>Subscription Tracker Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 2025-11-22</small></p>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Subscription Tracker (“the App”) helps you track subscriptions and expenses. We collect and process as little data as possible. Unless stated otherwise, all data stays on your device.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data We Handle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> name, category, price, cycle, reminder settings; stored locally via SwiftData. Not shared with servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> reminders are registered locally and depend on your system permission. Content includes subscription name and date; nothing is sent to any server.</li>
      <li><strong>Membership state:</strong> stored locally (UserProfile). Current purchase flow is a lifetime unlock placeholder; transactions are handled by Apple via StoreKit.</li>
      <li><strong>Settings:</strong> theme, language, notification toggle, default reminder lead days, etc., stored locally (AppSettings).</li>
      <li><strong>Ads (AdMob):</strong> to show ads, Google and partners may collect device identifiers, IP address, coarse location, and ad performance/interaction data. If you opt into personalized ads, we’ll request consent (e.g., ATT/consent form). You can adjust ad/tracking preferences in system settings or in-app options.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> in-app purchases. Payments and restores are processed by Apple; we do not receive your payment info.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple Notification Services:</strong> local notifications are handled by the system; we do not send notification data to a server.</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> used to display ads. It may use device identifiers, IP, coarse location, and ad interaction data to deliver, measure, and improve ads. Personalized ads rely on your consent and can be withdrawn anytime.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. To provide ads, we share necessary ad-serving/billing data with AdMob and its partners. If cloud sync or other third-party services are introduced later, we will notify you and seek consent.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is stored in your device’s app sandbox and protected by system storage/encryption.</li>
      <li>If you enable device backups (e.g., iCloud backups), data may be included there and is protected by Apple.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> disable in system settings or in-app; when disabled, pending reminders are canceled.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> restore via the App Store; refunds follow Apple’s policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> uninstalling removes local data; if you use device backups, manage those backups accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app targets general users and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. Significant changes will be noted in app release notes. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.</p>

# Subscription Tracker Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-22

## Overview
Subscription Tracker (“the App”) helps you track subscriptions and expenses. We collect and process as little data as possible. Unless stated otherwise, all data stays on your device.

## Data We Handle
- **Subscription data**: name, category, price, cycle, reminder settings, etc., stored locally via SwiftData. Not shared with servers.
- **Notifications**: reminders are registered locally and depend on your system permission. Notification content includes the subscription name and date; nothing is sent to any server.
- **Membership state**: stored locally (UserProfile). Current purchase flow is a lifetime unlock placeholder; transactions are handled by Apple via StoreKit.
- **Settings**: theme, language, notification toggle, default reminder lead days, etc., stored locally (AppSettings).
- **Analytics/Ads**: no third-party analytics or ad SDKs are integrated at this time. If added in the future, we will update this policy and request consent.

## Third-Party Services
- **Apple StoreKit**: used for in-app purchases. Payments and restores are processed by Apple; we do not receive your payment info.
- **Apple Notification Services**: local notifications are handled by the system; we do not send notification data to a server.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. If cloud sync or third-party services are introduced later, we will notify you and seek consent.

## Data Security
- Data is stored in your device’s app sandbox and protected by system storage/encryption.
- If you enable device backups (e.g., iCloud backups), data may be included there and is protected by Apple.

## Your Choices
- **Notifications**: you can disable notifications in system settings or in-app; when disabled, pending reminders are cancelled.
- **Purchases**: you can restore purchases via the App Store; refunds follow Apple’s policies.
- **Delete data**: uninstalling the app removes local data; if you use device backups, manage those backups accordingly.

## Children’s Privacy
This app targets general users and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Significant changes will be noted in app release notes. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.

## Contact
For privacy questions, contact us via the in-app “Settings” contact entry (future update) or your platform support channel.
